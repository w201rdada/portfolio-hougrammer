Hello!  My name is David Hou and this is the my portfolio, where I write about two data science ideas that I have.

### Abstract of DeepCAD {-}

Mechanical engineers often have to solve problems that already have solutions or are similar enough to existing problems as to be virtually identical.  Computer aided design (CAD) software allows a portal into the digitization of mechanical design.  A machine learning algorithm can be trained to utilize the vast amounts of CAD data and perform certain design tasks automatically.  This algorithm is not just a database of existing designs for the engineer to reference.  Rather, it offers new designs based off of context and engineer preferences.  Early iterations of the algorithm will work simply suggesting components (e.g. screws and fasteners) to existing assemblies.  As the network gets more sophisticated, it will generate completely novel geometries.  Such an algorithm would slowly shift the design paradigm one where the engineer meticulously specifies each individual feature from the bottom-up to one where the engineer dictates a top level direction to the computer and then iterates based on necessary fixes.  This paradigm shift is fairly different from the status quo and will probably take a long time to penetrate the relatively traditionalist mechanical engineering industry.  However, the benefits of utilizing such an algorithm would be huge in terms of development time and cost.

### Abstract of ML-Majors {-}

College major selection is a pivotal time in a young adult’s life, but statistics show that the process is poorly executed. The system is ripe for a data-driven tool to provide keen insights and promote career satisfaction. We propose a machine learning system that combines student personality traits, academic strengths, and major marketability to provide a fully integrated recommendation system. Our system will employ four technical components: a web portal, data ingestion, data storage, and finally a recommendation engine. Data will be intaken via student input, alumni surveys, and social profile mining. The engine operates via a deep neural network capable of unearthing subtle trends from the provided inputs and linking them to the long list of available majors. The primary advantages of machine learning are the ability to discover previously unforeseen trends and the ability to harness larger amounts of data than the human brain can comprehend.  The tool’s primary objective will be career satisfaction.  We will track students throughout their time at the university and for five years after graduation as a performance metric for the algorithm. The goal is to empower our students in their search for both a career and a passion.

  

## About the author {-}

I am mechanical engineer who works in Santa Clara, CA.  I see a lot of inefficiences in my company in terms of the organization of our CAD library.  It makes finding and designing parts much slower than it should be.  While our database of parts is much too large for humans to manually go through and clean, it is certainly feasible for a machine learning algorithm.  

Certainly, machine learning and data science have become heavy interests of mine in recent years.  After completely my undergraduate degree and getting halfway through my master's in mechanical engineering, I realized that the major may not have been the best fit for me.  I had chosen ME purely due to performing well in high school math and science.  I really wish that I had the opportunity to explore more majors before selecting one for my degree.
